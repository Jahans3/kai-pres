                    Fundamentals: Terminating Lines

                    <section>
                        In the vast majority of languages you must terminate each line of code with a semi-colon, this is so the compiler knows where each line starts and ends.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        This is not true for JavaScript, but it is strongly recommended that you do use semi-colons, as there are some (albeit rare) cases where this can causes bugs.

                    <div>Fundamentals: Operators</div>

                        Operators are largely universal, with only slight differences between programming languages.

                        5 === '5' = false;
                        <br><br>
                        Note that the second '5' here is in quotes, meaning it is a String, there it is a different type to 5, which is a Number
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        Is not equal to: !=
                        <br><br>
                        5 != '5' = false;
                        <br><br>
                        Note that here we are not checking the type of the second 5, so it is inferred (coerced) into a Number type to check against the 5
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        Is not equal to and not the same type: !==
                        <br><br>
                        5 !== '5' = true;
                        <br><br>
                        Here we do check the type, so "5 does not equal five AND is not the same type" results in true, because although both are 5, one is a type of String, while the other is a Number

                    Fundamentals: Constructs
                    <section>
                        <div>A programming or data construct is a piece of data constructed of other, smaller types of data</div>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <div>The first construct you will probably see will be an array, defined using square brackets []</div>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <div>An array is an object that simply stores multiple pieces of a data in a sequence, with each data piece separated by a comma, here is one being assigned to the variable myArray:</div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            let myArray = [5, 10, 15];
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <div>Each piece of data in an array is called an element and is accessed by an index</div>
                        <br>
                        <div>let myArray = [5, 10, 15];</div>
                        <br>
                        <div>console.log(myArray[0]); - Result: 5</div>
                        <br>
                        <div>Important: In computing terms, we begin counting at 0, so to access the first element of myArray we used 0.</div>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <div>Another common construct is the Object, this is a tree of key:value pairs and is denoted using curly braces. Here is one being assigned to the variable myObject:</div>
                        <br>
                        <div style="text-align: left; width: 350px; margin: 0 auto">
                            let myObject = { <br>
                                propertyOne: 'value1', <br>
                                propertyTwo: 500, <br>
                            };
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>Think of each property as a variable, meaning you can assign any value you like to it.</div>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <div>To access the value of a property of an object use dot notation:</div>
                        <br>
                        <div>console.log(myObject.propertyOne); - Result: "value1"</div>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        Another common construct is a function, more on these in a bit

                        Loops can take many forms, but they all follow the same fundamental principle of executing a block of code over and over

                            Other types of iterables:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>while loop - keeps looping "while" a given condition is true</li>
                                    <li>Iterable methods - functions belonging to specific objects designed to iterate over objects (usually of the type they are attached to)</li>
                                    <li>Recursive functions - recursion in maths is the repeated application of a procedure - exactly the same in computer science. This is a function that calls itself.</li>
                                </ul>

                    Functions
                    <section>
                        Functions are essential to programming, they are blocks of code that can be executed on-demand with given parameters that will modify the result.
                        <br> <br>
                        It is the programming equivalent of "function machines" from school, where you give some numbers to the machine and it gives you something different back based on the given values, except where function machines have access to theoretical numbers, computational functions have access to the system they are running on

                        Take this function, myFunction, that accepts the argument "number" and adds 1, then prints it: <br> <br>

                    Programming for the web: JavaScript

                    <section>
                        JavaScript is:

                        <br><br>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Interpreted</li>
                                <li>Loosely-typed, ie. you don't specify data types, the interpreter infers them</li>
                                <li>Runs in the browser</li>
                                <li>Has deep integration with browsers, allowing you do to do almost anything you want</li>
                                <li>Follows the ECMAScript spec</li>
                                <li>String and independent: don't need no man</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        JavaScript does not require you to specify data types when defining variables, but there are different types of variable
                        <br><br>
                        const - declare a variable and do NOT allow the value to be changed, the value is "constant"<br>
                        let - declare a variable that can be changed <br>
                        var - has very specific use-cases, can forget about this one for now <br>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        Since JavaScript is loosely-typed, but you still need to be able to check types, they are broken down into simple categories:

                        <br>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Boolean - true/false</li>
                                <li>String - text</li>
                                <li>Number - numbers. In JavaScript this value is a number between +2^53 - 1 and -2^53 - 1</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>These categories are known as "primitives"</div>

                        Functions in JavaScript are treated as first-class objects, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as parameters to other functions, and are able to be treated like normal data types.
                        <br><br>
                        This is not true for a lot of languages, meaning you have more freedom when writing JS.

                        Functions:
                        <br><br>
                        Declared using the "function" keyword, or the lambda symbol, "=>"
                        <br>
                        Different function declarations have different implications, for now we will focus on "function"

                        Functions:
                        <br>
                        Declare a function by writing the keyword "function" followed by the function name, then brackets, if you want to pass parameters, you should define them in the brackets:
                        <br><br>
                        <div style="font-family: monospace; text-align: left;padding-left: 200px;">function sayHello(name){ <br> console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); <br> };</div>

                        Functions:
                        <br>
                        Execute (call) a function by writing out the name (known as a symbol) and putting brackets next to it, placing any parameters between the brackets:
                        <br><br>
                        <div style="font-family: monospace; text-align: left;padding-left: 200px;">sayHello('kai'); <br> Result: "Hello, kai!"</div>

                        Functions:
                        <br>
                        Functions can be stored inside variables:
                        <br><br>
                        <div style="font-family: monospace; text-align: left;padding-left: 200px;">let sayHello = function (name){ <br> console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); <br> };</div>
